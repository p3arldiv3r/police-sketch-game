# police-sketch-game
"it's a game based off police sketch artists:
players can each put in a list of three names before the round begins (like gartic phone)
each round, everyone is given the chance to choose from 3 names. with the name they chose, they get 1 min (or more depending on settings chosen) to write a description  for the character withOUT giving away who it is. works best if nobody else knows what all was put into the game.
after that, it switches to the next round. players are given 1-3 minutes (idk how long would be proper) to draw the person / character ONLY based on the description.
finally, final part of the round, everyone puts in who they think the character is everytime a picture is shown. id say make it not case sensitive and allow both full name or just one name. either that or let them choose from options (might make it too easy tho) 
the amount of people who guess right, the amount of points you get. if you guess right you also get points.
a mix of skribble.io, gartic phone and frantic fanfic pretty much"
